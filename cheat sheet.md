| **HTTP/2** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2) | Evolution of HTTP with binary framing and multiplexing. | High-performance APIs | Reduces latency via multiplexing, header compression. | Deploy with Nginx (HTTP/2 module) or gRPC over HTTP/2. |
| **gRPC** (Google Remote Procedure Call) | High-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers. | Microservices, RPC | Low-latency, strongly-typed, supports streaming. | Use gRPC-Go with Protobuf; integrate with Kubernetes. |
| **WebSockets** | Persistent, bidirectional connection over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). | Real-time apps (chat, gaming) | Full-duplex, low overhead for live updates. | Implement with `Socket.IO` or `ws` (Node.js); scale with Redis Pub/Sub. |
| **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) | Lightweight pub/sub protocol for resource-constrained devices. | IoT (Internet of Things), telemetry | Bandwidth-efficient, reliable over unstable networks. | Use Mosquitto broker; connect with Paho MQTT client. |

**Tricky Question**: *How does HTTP/2's multiplexing improve performance compared to HTTP/1.1?*  
**Answer**: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses concurrently over a single TCP connection, reducing latency and improving resource utilization compared to HTTP/1.1â€™s sequential requests.

**Tricky Question**: *When would you choose gRPC over REST for a microservices architecture?*  
**Answer**: gRPC is ideal for low-latency, high-performance scenarios, especially with real-time communication or when strong typing and efficient serialization are needed.

| **APIs** (Application Programming Interface) | Interfaces for programmatic interaction. | REST, gRPC | REST: simple, gRPC: performant. | Build REST with FastAPI; gRPC with Protobuf. |
| **CDN** (Content Delivery Network) | Edge servers caching static content globally. | Cloudflare, Akamai | Lowers latency, offloads origin (e.g., Netflix). | Configure Cloudflare with origin pull; cache static files. |
| **Proxy vs Reverse Proxy** | Proxy forwards client requests; reverse proxy distributes to servers. | Nginx, HAProxy | Proxy: client-side, Reverse: server-side load balancing. | Use Nginx as reverse proxy with upstreams; proxy via client configs. |
| **DNS** (Domain Name System) | Resolves domain names to IP addresses. | AWS Route 53, Cloudflare DNS | Fast, reliable name resolution. | Set Route 53 with geo-DNS; use Cloudflare for DDoS protection. |
| **API Gateway** | Centralized entry point for API management. | Kong, AWS API Gateway | Handles auth, throttling, routing (e.g., microservices). | Deploy Kong with plugins; use AWS Gateway with Lambda. |

**Tricky Question**: *How does an API gateway enhance security in a microservices architecture?*  
**Answer**: It centralizes authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, providing a single secure entry point.

**Tricky Question**: *What are the differences between a proxy and a reverse proxy?*  
**Answer**: Proxies forward client requests to servers; reverse proxies receive requests for servers, often for load balancing/caching.

| **Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling** | Vertical: bigger machine; Horizontal: more machines. | Vertical for power, Horizontal for distribution | Vertical: simple, Horizontal: scalable. | Benchmark with JMeter; simulate with Kubernetes. |
| **Concurrency vs Parallelism** | Concurrency: task switching; Parallelism: simultaneous execution. | Concurrency for multitasking, Parallelism for speed | Concurrency: responsiveness, Parallelism: throughput. | Profile with `perf` or `concurrent.futures` (Python). |
| **Long Polling vs WebSockets** | Long Polling: HTTP waits; WebSockets: persistent connection. | Long Polling for legacy, WebSockets for real-time | Long Polling: compatible, WebSockets: efficient. | Test with Postman (Long Polling) vs. `ws` (WebSockets). |
| **Batch vs Stream Processing** | Batch: processes chunks; Stream: real-time flow. | Batch for datasets, Stream for real-time | Batch: analytics, Stream: immediacy. | Compare Spark (batch) vs. Kafka Streams (stream). |
| **Stateful vs Stateless Design** | Stateful: retains context; Stateless: no memory. | Stateful for sessions, Stateless for scalability | Stateful: simple sessions, Stateless: scale. | Simulate with Redis (stateful) vs. REST (stateless). |
| **Strong vs Eventual Consistency** | Strong: immediate sync; Eventual: delayed sync. | Strong for transactions, Eventual for scalability | Strong: accuracy, Eventual: performance. | Test with Jepsen or Chaos Monkey for consistency. |

**Tricky Question**: *How do you decide between using a relational database and a NoSQL database?*  
**Answer**: Consider data structure, scalability, consistency needs, and query complexity (e.g., relational for structured data, NoSQL for scale).

**Tricky Question**: *What are the implications of choosing strong consistency over eventual consistency?*  
**Answer**: Strong consistency ensures accuracy but may reduce availability/performance; eventual consistency prioritizes availability.

| **Distributed Tracing** | Tracks requests across microservices. | Jaeger (Jaeger Tracing), Zipkin (Zipkin Tracing) | Debugs latency, dependencies. | Use OpenTelemetry with Jaeger; visualize traces. |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Restores system post-failure. | Backups, Replication, Failover | Ensures continuity (e.g., outages). | Use S3 backups, MySQL replication, HAProxy failover. |
| **Distributed Web Crawler** | Parallel web scraping across nodes. | Kafka, Redis, Bloom Filters (Bloom Filter Data Structure) | Kafka: task queue, Bloom: deduplication. | Kafka for jobs, Redis for state, Bloom for uniqueness. |
| **Distributed Cloud Storage** | Scalable, redundant file storage. | Consistent Hashing, Replication, Sharding | Fault-tolerant scale (e.g., S3). | Use hash rings, replicate with HDFS, shard data. |
| **Bloom Filters** | Probabilistic structure for set membership. | Redis Bloom, custom implementation | Space-efficient deduplication. | Use Redis Bloom module or `pybloomfiltermmap`. |
| **Zero-Trust Architecture** (Zero-Trust Security Model) | Security model assuming no implicit trust. | Istio (Istio Service Mesh), OAuth2 (Open Authorization 2.0) | Mitigates insider threats, breaches. | Use Istio for service mesh; OAuth2 for auth. |
| **Chaos Engineering** (Chaos Engineering Practice) | Intentionally injects failures to test resilience. | Chaos Monkey (Chaos Monkey Tool), Gremlin (Gremlin Chaos Engineering Platform) | Validates fault tolerance (e.g., Netflix). | Deploy Chaos Monkey on AWS; script failure scenarios. |

**Tricky Question**: *How does distributed tracing help in debugging microservices?*  
**Answer**: It provides end-to-end visibility into request flows, identifying bottlenecks and failures across services.

**Tricky Question**: *What are the key components of a zero-trust architecture?*  
**Answer**: Strict identity verification, least privilege access, and continuous monitoring secure resources.
