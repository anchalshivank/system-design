I put together a simple repository to help with software engineering interview preparation.

The idea is pretty straightforward. While preparing for interviews, we often run into terms and concepts that we’ve either never heard before or never fully understood. This repo is meant to act as a compact reference for exactly that.

Instead of going through multiple books or endless resources, you can skim through this sheet. If something doesn’t make sense, you can deep-dive into that specific topic on your own. The goal is to keep things simple and practical.

This is not meant to be exhaustive. Too much information can be overwhelming and counterproductive. Simplicity wins.

Contributions, improvements, and suggestions are always welcome 🙂
